## Using the Uinstallation scripts

To use the installation scripts, simply run this command as root. The script will ask you whether you would like to Uninstall just the Panel or Wings

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OPKns/pterodactyl-uninstaller/main/uninstaller.sh)
```

_Note: On some systems, it's required to be already logged in as root before executing the one-line command (where `sudo` is in front of the command does not work)._
